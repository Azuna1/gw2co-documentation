## OBJECT LOCATOR MODULE

This module renders a window with all the agent types as checkboxes to filter out types of interest. When a filter is selected, a list of buttons representing filtered agent types are rendered that can be clicked. 

On clicking an agent, a line is drawn between your character and the agent. A log entry is written to file and the console with some basic information.
